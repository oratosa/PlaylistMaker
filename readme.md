# PlaylistMaker
PlaylistMaker gets the track info broadcasted on [Weekend Sunshine](https://www4.nhk.or.jp/sunshine/66/) and creates a playlist on Spotify.

Those playlists are here: https://open.spotify.com/user/213qnu6e3ycwpsfevbtit2tjy?si=PKQUuNWhTSatT9xufyD60A

## How does it work?
This works weekly on Google Cloud Functions.
